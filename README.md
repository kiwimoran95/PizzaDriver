# PizzaDriver
App for Android for delivery pizza drivers so clients can track their order

This app developed in Android Studio lets the pizza driver guy upload his location associated with his ID to the server, 
so the clients can see the location of their pizza in real time on the map by typing the driver's ID.

It consumes REST services.
